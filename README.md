# Wyncode-Project2-Rails-MVC

My second weekend project at Wyncode Academy in Miami, FL.

We had to send requests to an API of our choosing in a rails environment. 
This project helped me to gain familiarity with the MVC architectural pattern.
I chose to send GET requests to the Github API in order to recieve information about particular users.
